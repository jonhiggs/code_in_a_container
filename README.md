# Code In A Container

An experiment in moving my development environment inside a Docker container.

The idea was that maybe I could pair program by throwing my environment inside a Docker container then all the collaborators could connect to the Docker host and jump into a shared tmux session.

## Limitations

- Docker in Docker could be annoying.
- No access to the window manager


## Features

- Shared tmux


## TODO

- ruby
- python
